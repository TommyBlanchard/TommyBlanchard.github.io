&lt;p&gt;Let me make clear that this isn’t just …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve read a lot of attempts at defining data scientist and differentiating it from other data-centric roles. The terms ‘data scientist’, ‘data analyst’, and ‘data engineer’ are obviously interrelated. But recently I’ve seen some weird definitions of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me make clear that this isn’t just a silly semantic quibble with no practical significance (though it certainly is partially, maybe largely, that). This issue often comes up when people are giving career advice. A &lt;a href="http://nadbordrozd.github.io/blog/2017/12/10/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-data-science-2-data-analyst-roles-are-poison/"&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; defined a data analyst as someone who interrogates data using SQL and Excel to produce reports, while a data scientist is someone who delivers software. This is a lead in to advice that a data analyst position is not good preparation for a data scientist position because data scientists are basically software engineers and data analyst positions don’t give you that experience. The premise, however, is based on an extremely narrow definition of both of these roles that might only be true in certain companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of silly definitions for these roles came from a reddit thread I read, where someone was claiming that anyone who regularly uses pandas/sk-learn must be a data engineer. This bizarre claim seemed to stem from an idea that legitimate data scientists are at the forefront of machine learning research and therefore must be programming completely new machine learning algorithms from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: if anyone claims a very clear, straightforward definition of any of these roles that sharply delineates them, they are probably extrapolating based on experience of how these roles are defined in one company (or industry). This is because these jobs, by their very nature, have a lot of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would give the high-level, fuzzy (and hopefully not controversial) definitions of these roles as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data engineer&lt;/strong&gt;: a data professional who focuses on building data pipelines, manages how to get data from point A to point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data analyst&lt;/strong&gt;: a data professional who focuses on producing reports describing trends/insights in data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data scientist&lt;/strong&gt;: a data professional who focuses on producing insights and predictions from data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note my use of the weasel phrase ‘focuses on’ to avoid making any hard statements. Because at bottom, each of these roles overlaps significantly with the others - it’s typical for data professionals to need to extract data or move it around. It’s not uncommon for data engineers to produce dashboards or reports, or for data analysts to set up data pipelines. Data scientists may sometimes produce reports, and some data analysts are deliver code to go into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any hard line you can think of (data scientists use machine learning, data analysts use excel, etc, etc) there are going to be lots of counter-examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, there is a difference in these roles. It’s a fuzzy yet important one. Typically data scientists are more specialized and have more experience/skills than data analysts. Data engineers might have more knowledge of databases but less about statistics. But the field is not at a point where you can easily determine the total extent of the role just by the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, if you’re looking to become a data scientist and want to know what path to take, getting experience as a data analyst (or data engineer) might not be a bad way to go about it. However, it’s dependent on the specifics of the particular position you get. If you’re a data analyst who sits with business people and only use excel to produce simple reports, you’re not going to get the kind of experience you need to move on to a data science position. But if you work closely with other data scientists, or are expected to learn stats/machine learning to perform your duties, it might be good experience. I think &lt;a href="http://nadbordrozd.github.io/blog/2017/12/10/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-data-science-2-data-analyst-roles-are-poison/"&gt;the blog post I mentioned above&lt;/a&gt; does give good advice on this - be concerned about who you’ll be sitting with, since that probably says a lot about what skills you’ll learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data science"></category><category term="Data analyst"></category><category term="Data engineer"></category></entry><entry><title>“Should I get a PhD to be a data scientist/analytics professional?”</title><link href="http://tommyblanchard.com/should-i-get-a-phd-to-be-a-data-scientistanalytics-professional" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Tommy Blanchard</name></author><id>tag:tommyblanchard.com,2017-11-19:/should-i-get-a-phd-to-be-a-data-scientistanalytics-professional</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s some advice I’ve read that &lt;a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/"&gt;“when you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post”&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve decided to take that advice and write some of my thoughts on getting a PhD to go into industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Opportunity Costs of Getting a PhD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s some advice I’ve read that &lt;a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/"&gt;“when you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post”&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve decided to take that advice and write some of my thoughts on getting a PhD to go into industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Opportunity Costs of Getting a PhD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, having a PhD on your resume, all else being equal, helps you. It shows you’re smart and have a variety of skills. It also gives you a number of important skills for industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But asking whether a PhD is a good thing to have on your resume isn’t the right question. Is having a PhD better than having 5+ years of industry experience, or a Master’s degree and a couple of years of experience? My guess is in most cases, no. PhDs take a long time, and aren’t very efficient for learning the specific skills for an industry job. PhDs train you to be a researcher in a very specific field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, if you’re just looking for a way of advancing your career, in most cases you’re better off doing something other than getting a PhD. There might be some exceptions to this - like if you’re planning on getting a PhD in machine learning. But for the most part, a PhD is just a slow way of learning some skills. When you factor in the financial opportunity costs as well, it just doesn’t make sense to get a PhD if you’re doing it just for your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Risks of Enrolling in a PhD Program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I don’t see brought up enough in discussions about getting a PhD is that getting a PhD carries significant risk. A large proportion of students (&lt;a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/PhD-Attrition-How-Much-Is/140045"&gt;estimated ~50%&lt;/a&gt;) don’t complete their PhD. Everyone thinks that these statistics don’t apply to them, but quite simply, there is a lot of luck involved in getting a PhD. Many advisers just aren’t good (or have styles that don’t jive well with your own), some departments suck, some research plans don’t pan out. On top of that, sometimes life circumstances get in the way - you have a kid, a family member gets sick, or you find you can’t continue doing it for financial reasons. These are things it’s hard to know ahead of time. There is always a chance things just won’t work out with your PhD program, or that it will require much more time than you originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing it for the Wrong Reasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally - if you’re getting a PhD just thinking about what it’s going to give you on the other end, you’re doing it for the wrong reasons. If you’re not seriously excited about the prospect of doing academic research for the next few years, you’re just not going to gain much from the experience. A PhD is a long commitment - 5+ years might as well be a lifetime. It’s also a lot of work - I worked much harder during my PhD than I have at any other point in my life. Academia can also be extremely lonely and isolating, &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/reasons-i-left-academia"&gt;as I've written about before&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t happy and motivated by the work you’re doing during that time, you’re (1) not going to accomplish much, (2) not learn much, and (3) miss out on enjoying a big chunk of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not against the idea of getting a PhD, and going into it planning to take an industry job after isn’t a bad idea (it’s probably better than going into it expecting a tenure-track academic job, given &lt;a href="https://lifesciencenetwork11.connectedcommunity.org/blogs/leah-cannon/2016/09/15/how-many-phd-graduates-become-professors"&gt;the prospects of that&lt;/a&gt;). However, I think if you’re going to do a PhD, it should be because you love the idea of doing a PhD. If it’s just something you’re trying to get through for the position and prestige you feel you’ll have on the other end, it really isn’t worth it. Given the risks involved, the financial hardship it entails, the cost to your mental health, I really believe you should only do a PhD if you would want to do it even if it wouldn’t actually help your career at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Academia"></category><category term="Industry"></category></entry><entry><title>Data Science in Healthcare</title><link href="http://tommyblanchard.com/data-science-in-healthcare" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Tommy Blanchard</name></author><id>tag:tommyblanchard.com,2017-11-14:/data-science-in-healthcare</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently written a couple of guest blog posts about data science in the healthcare space.&lt;/p&gt;

You get to learn with others …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a review of my experience in &lt;a href="http://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html?ref=ce730ff6c5d6&amp;amp;ch=ge"&gt;the Data Incubator data science program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to make the switch from academia to data science, I went the route of doing a bootcamp. There is a lot that is appealing about this route. You get to learn with others in the same position as you. Having assignments and lessons forced on you can be a powerful motivator to learn and get experience. Having a fully worked out curriculum can mean getting a larger, better rounded introduction to the field than if you tried to learn on your own. Finally, many bootcamps explicitly market themselves to academics, which I found attractive given my background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I decided to attend a bootcamp to launch my data science career. I ended up attending Data Incubator, in the September-October 2016 cohort. While I did end up getting a job through the program, I still left it with some mixed feelings about the program and thought writing some details may be helpful for someone trying to make a decision about attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, if not all, data science bootcamps have some kind of admission process. For some, this means just sending a resume and going through an interview. Others involve short technical challenges to test your statistics/programming to see if you're at the level they expect students of the program to be at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for a bunch of different programs and went through a few different admissions tests. By far the Data Incubator's was the most involved. After applying with typical application paperwork and getting reference letters, if you're chosen you're given challenge questions - programming questions that are pretty challenging that you only have a few days to complete. There is no way to reschedule so if you happen to be travelling during the scheduled time (like I was), you just have to figure out a way to do it. Along with the challenge questions, you have to come up with a project for the program, and do some initial exploratory analysis. If you make it through to the semi-finalist stage, you need to put together more analyses for the project proposal and prepare to do a short pitch in an interview. All of this took many stressful hours of preparation time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to Data Incubator's main competitor, &lt;a href="http://insightdatascience.com/"&gt;Insight&lt;/a&gt;, where I did an initial application and an interview and that was it. That application took perhaps an hour or two (and was also successful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the work you put into the Data Incubator application, you're not told until the end if you're accepted as a 'fellow' (no tuition), or a 'scholar' ($15k for the program). My hunch (based on a small sample size) is that they are strongly biased towards giving 'fellowships' to PhDs, and most Masters applicants end up with 'scholar' status if they are accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strengths of the program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of the program is that the assignments are diverse and do a good job of introducing you to a range of topics and tools. In contrast to Insight (where, my understanding is, you're given resources and a list of things you should do but no real lectures or assignments), there is a pretty structured curriculum that makes it clear what you're supposed to be learning and when. The fact that they are assignments forces you to actually get your hands dirty working with powerful different Python tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the program is the focus on programming skills. As well as the assignments which are mostly expected to be done in Python, four days a week the program starts with an hour long coding challenge. I came in having basically taught myself Python to complete the application. By the time I finished, Python was my most comfortable language and I felt very confident in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course includes in its curriculum some basic job skills that many people transitioning to data science lack: how to sell yourself to employers as a data scientist. There is advice and feedback on making a resume and interview practice. While some of this was a bit too obvious to be useful, I found some tips and advice helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the course provides what any bootcamp should: a social learning experience where you're immersed and forced to learn a lot in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaknesses of the program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program includes daily lectures. On paper, this sounds great, but in practice it's terrible. The hour-long lectures are frequently unhelpful because they often come after you've already learned the content while trying to complete the assignment for that week. When they are timely, they frequently are just low quality that make it hard to gain anything from. Most lectures are also remote - being teleconferenced from one of the other Data Incubator locations. The remote lectures raise barriers to interacting with the lecturer, and the sound quality is often poor enough that it takes just too much effort to pay attention. I found myself frequently using lecture time as lunch hour so the time wasn't a complete waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the curriculum structure also just didn't make sense. We had an assignment nominally supposed to teach us SQL, even though we had no resources for being taught how to even set up SQL on our machines (everyone ended up completing the assignment using Python's Pandas). One of the last weeks of the program we suddenly switched to using Scala for the morning programming challenges, despite using Python for everything else in the program. We came in Monday morning for our weekly assignment, and were literally given an hour to complete a challenge in a language none of us had ever used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertising of the program is slick but the reality often falls short. The variety of companies hiring from the program is greatly exaggerated. Based on the marketing, I was expecting them to have hiring partners all over the country with a large variety of industries. There was exactly one non-profit, zero video-game companies that were hiring. There were only a couple of jobs in all of Boston. One student at my location just left the program immediately after seeing how limited his job options were in his geographical area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other problems with the course were deeper than just poor course planning. There seemed to be a deep distrust and infantilization of the students woven into the philosophy of the course. If we failed to complete an assignment on time, we were punished by being locked out of the system for contacting hiring partners until we caught up. One fellow in my cohort was locked out of the system as punishment for turning down a bad job offer. The 'soft skills' lectures (which were really 'job search' lectures) were at best not useful, but frequently condescending and verged on outright insulting people with academic backgrounds. We were routinely encouraged to apply for jobs we weren't interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the program was useful for me. I probably could have gotten a data science job without it, but I am glad I did it. There are ugly parts of the program, but it was free training for me and did end up landing me a job, so I can't complain too much. However, I don't view it particularly favorably compared to Insight (a program I've only heard good things about from a few of my friends who have gone through it). I also am not convinced a bootcamp is necessary for the job - I actually got more data science interviews that weren't through Data Incubator, and it's mostly fluke that I got my job through Data Incubator instead of on my own. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data science training"></category><category term="Bootcamps"></category><category term="Job hunting"></category><category term="Data science"></category></entry><entry><title>How to make the transition from academia to data science</title><link href="http://tommyblanchard.com/how-to-make-the-transition-from-academia-to-data-science" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tommy Blanchard</name></author><id>tag:tommyblanchard.com,2017-04-23:/how-to-make-the-transition-from-academia-to-data-science</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I've started writing about my transition from academia to industry (both &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/reasons-i-left-academia"&gt;my reasons for leaving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/retrospective-on-leaving-academia-for-industry-data-science"&gt;what I think about the transition in retrospect&lt;/a&gt;), I've started receiving a lot of requests for advice on making that transition.

Sometimes these requests come from former peers, former professors looking to advise students, or just someone who read one of my blog posts online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm always happy to reply to these requests as best as I can given my experiences, but I figured since so many people seem interested I it might be useful to put my thoughts in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do I need to know to be a data scientist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main message to most of the people that have been asking me for advice is not to worry too much. People seem to think you need to know everything to be a data scientist. If you have a PhD in the sciences or any quantitative discipline, you're likely most of the way to having the skills you need, so don't be scared to take that next step (by just looking at and applying to jobs). Put yourself out there and let potential employers decide whether you have the skills to work for them or not, don't do their job for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to know what I think are the essentials to get a first data science position, the main classes of skills you need to have should come as no surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a decent programmer&lt;/strong&gt;: Python and R are the languages that are most common. Being comfortable in both opens more doors, but you can make due with one or the other. SQL is also used frequently, so at least do a short tutorial on it (basic queries are simple enough that it's not super difficult to pick up the necessities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know some machine-learning&lt;/strong&gt;: You should understand basic machine-learning concepts and have at some experience with some of the most common algorithms (like tree-based methods, logistic regression, dimensionality reduction, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know some traditional stats&lt;/strong&gt;: You should know about p-values, regressions, t-tests, statistical significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the bare essentials. You'll need to be more than just 'decent' in at least one of these categories (which one depends on the job, read on), but the point is, these should be skills you already have or could gain in a short period of time through some additional reading/practice. The skills involved in data science are so broad, no one is an expert in all of them. As long as you know the basics, and have some areas where you're particularly strong, you should be able to find a somewhere that your skills could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other skills that are useful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people seem convinced that they need an understanding of every big data technology under the sun to be a data scientist. To the uninitiated, the bizarre names you might hear (Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB, etc.) just sound intimidating. The truth is, they're not that complicated, and you don't need to be an expert in them to get a data science job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different data science teams use different tools. Some may use some big data tools for everything and really need someone who can jump into that workflow right away. But in my experience, the majority of data science jobs have these skills listed as 'Preferred but not required', if they're listed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing specific packages and algorithms might be required by specific jobs. &lt;strong&gt;The best way to figure out what you might need to know for the kinds of jobs your interested in is to just start looking.&lt;/strong&gt; Go to &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; or any other job posting site and just start looking at jobs. Find some that interest you, and figure out what skills they want, and get to work on those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do I learn these skills?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get a sense of what skills you might need to gain or strengthen, where do you go to get them? For almost any package under the sun, it's easy to just google a tutorial or free online course to learn the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people opt to go to boot camps. My overall opinion is that they are good for getting a general overview if you can afford to take a couple of months off full-time, but I don't think they are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Start applying/interviewing as early as possible&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find I learn best by being forced to solve problems. I think what taught me the most about being a data scientist was &lt;em&gt;applying and interviewing&lt;/em&gt;. Interviewers will often give you a coding challenge or small project to work on at home before they bring you in for an in-person interview. These can be anything from a quick one hour coding exercise to a multi-day project where you have to implement a recommendation engine. These are great for learning, because they're nice small projects that are, by definition, what interviewers want you to know. Treating them as a learning exercise helps in two ways. First, they're efficient for learning skills. Second, it will take the edge off when, inevitably, you get rejected repeatedly after interviewing. Interviewing is hard and it can really suck to get rejected after you've put in a lot of time and effort and fallen in love with the idea of working at a particular company. A better mentality is to approach interviews as being a success as long as you've learned something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other good resources for learning some of the essential skills to being a data scientist. Here's a woefully incomplete guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my main piece of advice is this: You're probably closer than you know to getting a data science interview, and you should take the next steps (looking at job listings, or applying to some of them) as early as possible to better guide your search. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Academia"></category><category term="Industry"></category><category term="Job hunting"></category><category term="Data science"></category></entry><entry><title>Retrospective on leaving academia for industry data science</title><link href="http://tommyblanchard.com/retrospective-on-leaving-academia-for-industry-data-science" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tommy Blanchard</name></author><id>tag:tommyblanchard.com,2017-04-09:/retrospective-on-leaving-academia-for-industry-data-science</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been two and a half months since I left academia to take a job as a data scientist in industry.

Although I haven't been in my new job for very long yet, I wanted to check in with my current thoughts about whether the transition was worth it and the differences between working in academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, being an industry data scientist is a lot like being a post-doc. I'm paid to tackle intellectual problems, I have a lot of freedom in how I approach problems, and there is emphasis placed on professional development (attending conferences, etc.). Of course, there is a change of emphasis on what types of tasks I do - as an academic I spent a lot of time collecting data and writing, in industry the emphasis is more on doing analyses and communicating results verbally or through simple reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problems I had in academia I no longer have in industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the decision to do leave academia for a number of reasons, outlined in a &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/reasons-i-left-academia"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. The main reasons were that I was lonely, stressed out, and no longer found the research held any interest for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in industry, there's a lot less social isolation. It's rare that a day goes by where I'm not in some kind of meeting. While sometimes this can get frustrating when meetings seem unnecessary, I think a big part of the point of meetings is social. It's nice to get away from the desk and talk to people. I'm not the kind of person that often seeks out social interactions, and I think it's really good for me to be involved in various meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academia, it often felt like I alone had to figure out how to solve a problem (or come up with an idea) in isolation to save a project that might span years. The projects I've worked on in industry are just much less stressful. They tend to be smaller or have a much longer timeline. Perhaps most importantly, they tend to have more people involved so you can always get more input. The end product isn't a research paper, so often it makes sense to be a bit less rigorous if it means a quicker turn-around (depending on the needs of the project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, it's expected that you leave work at work. I have done small amounts of work on evenings and weekends since starting my new job, but it's seen as weird and definitely not expected. People will talk about how much they have to finish, but doing it on the weekend is still unthinkable for them. It keeps work from encroaching on my personal life, and keeps me from feeling guilty about working on other things for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry isn't without its problems, but I find them easier to overcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the time I'm interacting with more people throughout the course of a project, one downside of industry is that I have to explain things to many more non-technical people. In academic science, everyone knows some stats and some programming, so it's usually pretty easy to explain the idea behind analyses to someone regardless of their specific field. Now, I find myself talking to HR people or nurses who lack any math or programming understanding. This can lead to some frustration and talking at cross-purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the challenge of communicating with less technical people is just that - a challenge. I've always enjoyed explaining technical things in non-technical ways. It helps me to understand things when I'm forced to put it in simple terms. This is a bit more extreme - explaining sometimes complex algorithms and statistics to people who don't know the first thing about math or code. But it allows me to develop a skill to speak to a wider audience, and I think that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While projects are less stressful, the flip side is a feeling of less personal investment that makes it hard to feel passionate about projects. The projects can still be fun and interesting, but there isn't always a whole lot of deeper meaning in them. Relatedly, with academia, your work is in some ways open to the world. You get publications, maybe some media coverage, and are considered a recognized expert. Without going beyond your job, the same thing doesn't really happen in industry. I might get some publications due to my position, but media coverage (or any other sort of recognition outside of the company) is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once again, I find this issue much easier to deal with than the issues I had in academia. Though I have less passion for work projects, I have a lot more time and energy to put into my own personal projects. And this can be quite rewarding - I get to try different things, like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Potter_Overflow"&gt;coding silly twitter bots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/movie-genre-ratings"&gt;writing data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tommyblanchard.com/does-the-muslim-ban-make-us-safer"&gt;journalism pieces&lt;/a&gt;. I find I have a wider range of projects to work on for satisfaction than I did while an academic, where I felt like any side project should ultimately net me a publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A lot of clear benefits of industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had moments of wondering if I really did the right thing by leaving academia (usually when some reward of academia is made particularly salient). However, the thought doesn't usually last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, I value the types of freedom an industry job gives me far more than the types academia does. I have less freedom now in terms of what specific projects I take on. However, I have much more freedom to define where I live, what industry I work in, and all of the freedoms involved in having a much more secure financial situation. There are also a number of different ways I could take my career - I could transition into a management position or stay closer to development/implementation. I could try freelancing or consulting. While I'm happy where I am right now, it's good to know that I have a lot of options for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Academia"></category><category term="Life"></category><category term="Industry"></category><category term="Data science"></category></entry><entry><title>Reasons I left academia</title><link href="http://tommyblanchard.com/reasons-i-left-academia" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Tommy Blanchard</name></author><id>tag:tommyblanchard.com,2017-02-12:/reasons-i-left-academia</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently made the transition from academia to industry.

Some people were surprised I decided to leave - I had had a pretty successful academic career. So why did I want to leave? I've read a lot of articles and opinions on reasons people leave academia. The common reasons I often saw people cite for why they decided to leave didn't resonate with me. It's usually things like that the academic job market is too tough, or that industry pays better. The better pay is certainly nice, but that wasn't an impetus for my switch. I had never really worried about the job market. So why did I decide to leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Becoming unhappy in academia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty happy during my PhD. I learned a lot throughout it, got a lot of positive feedback, felt respected, and interacted with my peers a lot. Even so, by my last year, and especially after starting my postdoc, I was slowly becoming less satisfied. Eventually I was just not happy. I became stressed out, and research wasn't fun anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I was describing my work environment to my roommate who works in industry. I told him I had maybe one to three meetings with people throughout the week. I explained that during my day, I mostly was by myself in an office. He said that sounded like it really sucked. That off-hand comment was actually really eye-opening to me. It had never occurred to me that working in such isolation probably wasn't good for me. It seemed just like the natural process of becoming more independent would of course mean more isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a postdoc or a grad student, it would often just be me and my advisor on a project. If my advisor was busy (frequently the case), it meant I was alone on the project. If others were involved in the project, in my experience their involvement was pretty superficial and communications usually occurred via email, or meetings once every month or two. It really didn't feel like I had anyone 'with me' on solving issues on a project, which was stressful. More importantly, I felt lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to other friends in industry reinforced the impression that it was much less isolating to work in industry than in research. They talked about frequent code-reviews and stand-up meetings. Since project turn-around was much quicker, project meetings were much more frequent. There was always a lot of interaction going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Few reasons to stay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had pinpointed why I was feeling so unhappy, I did a lot of soul-searching on why I was so set on an academic career in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly the big advantages of academia are the intellectual satisfaction of research and the freedom to research what you want. However, I didn't feel intellectually satisfied. Science works slowly, with incremental advances. Every paper I wrote was just one interpretation of one small data set about what one small brain area did in one contrived task. I was familiar with the big theories in my field, and there wasn't any new big ideas that were exciting me any more. Intellectually, focusing on such a narrow space of science was just becoming boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intellectual freedom didn't sound that exciting to me anymore. Sure, I could set up a wide range of different experiments, except 1) they had to be in line with a fundable research plan, and 2) they had to lead to publications. It seemed more like pressure to come up with good ideas than freedom to do what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit ashamed to admit that for me, the factor that made the decision difficult was the level of fame and prestige that comes with being an academic researcher. It's nice to have your name on a bunch of publications, to get some media attention, and have international colleagues that respect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Costs of staying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My growing unhappiness forced me to really face the sacrifices I was making by staying in academia. The biggest issue for me was the cost to my personal relationships. Academia meant moving at the whims of the academic job market - due to how few jobs there are, there's little freedom in where you live geographically. Already the moves I had done for academia had cost me important relationships. There was also putting off thinking about starting a family because I didn't feel like my life was stable enough to start one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deciding to leave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there's a big disconnect in mentality between academia and industry because they offer very different types of rewards. In academia, all of the metrics you have for how well you're doing don't exist in industry: publications, citations, H-index, etc. Until I really started to feel the cost of academia in terms of my happiness, I never felt the allure of industry because it didn't offer me these rewards I had been trained to seek through my academic training. Similarly, it was easy to ignore the income one could make in industry because money isn't one of the big motivators in academia since (at least at the postdoc level) everyone is making about the same low amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was forced to really open my eyes to the possibility of leaving, suddenly I had to consider what an industry job could offer me. It was painful going through the process of changing my mentality and accepting that I might never get another publication, but that was okay because publications only mean anything in academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started learning more about data science. I learned how it would allow me to work with different data, do the parts of science I love (analysis), and give me freedom to find jobs I wanted. I thought it sounded like a much better place for me. Hopefully that judgment was right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a retrospective on my first few months in industry and how I feel now about the move from academia.

This website is meant partially to replace my academic website. It's also a place for me to showcase some of my personal data science projects. I'll probably be starting with some of the small projects I've done while building up some of my data science skills, and hopefully eventually be releasing some more polished projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also intend to write blog entries (like this one). While my projects will tend to be something that involved coding, learning a new skill, and/or exploring a data set, blog entries will just be free-form writing. I mostly intend to write about data science, statistics, science, and related things. Because I've so recently come from academia, I expect many will focus on the difference between academia and industry, and the transition. And sometimes maybe I'll write about things completely unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is still somewhat under construction, and the organization of it might change quite a bit as it grows/matures.&lt;/p&gt;
